2. **Knowledge Base**: Complete information about the candidate
   - Skills (technical, soft, tools, languages, frameworks)
   - Experience (jobs, companies, roles, achievements, durations)
   - Education (degrees, institutions, fields of study, GPA if available)

## Your Task

Generate a tailored resume in **Markdown format** that:

1. **Prioritizes Relevant Information**
   - Lead with most relevant skills and experience
   - Highlight experiences matching the JD requirements
   - Emphasize achievements using metrics when available

2. **Uses Keywords from JD**
   - **CRITICAL**: Incorporate exact phrases and keywords from the job requirements list (provided separately)
   - Mirror the language/terminology used in the JD precisely (e.g., if JD says "Kubernetes", use "Kubernetes" not "K8s")
   - Use the EXACT technical terms from the JD (case-sensitive where appropriate)
   - Prioritize keywords in Skills section, then weave them naturally into experience bullets
   - ATS systems scan for exact keyword matches - be precise!
   - Don't force keywords unnaturally - only use where truthful and relevant

3. **Quantifies Achievements**
   - Use numbers, percentages, dollar amounts where available
   - Show impact: "Reduced costs by 30%" vs "Reduced costs"
   - Format: "Achieved X by doing Y, resulting in Z"

4. **Maintains Truthfulness**
   - Only use information from the knowledge base
   - Don't fabricate skills, experiences, or achievements
   - If data is missing, omit rather than invent

5. **Follows Best Practices**
   - Professional tone, action verbs, concise bullet points
   - Reverse chronological order (most recent first)
   - 1-2 pages worth of content
   - No personal pronouns (I, me, my)

## Output Format

Return the resume in **Markdown** format with the following structure:

**CRITICAL: Use ACTUAL VALUES from the knowledge base. DO NOT use placeholders like [Candidate Name], [email], [phone], etc.**

**CRITICAL: The contact information MUST use the EXACT values provided in the knowledge base:**
- If name is "Jane Doe", write "Jane Doe" NOT "[Candidate Name]"
- If email is "jane@example.com", write "jane@example.com" NOT "[email]"
- If phone is "+65 9123 4567", write "+65 9123 4567" NOT "[phone]"
- If linkedin_profile_url is "https://linkedin.com/in/johndoe", write that exact URL
- If github_username is "johndoe", write "github.com/johndoe"

```markdown
# [Use candidate's actual name from knowledge base]

**Email:** [Use candidate's actual email from contact.email] | **Phone:** [Use contact.phone if provided] | **LinkedIn:** [Use contact.linkedin_profile_url if provided] | **GitHub:** [Use "github.com/" + contact.github_username if github_username is provided]

## Important Notes

1. **Prioritization is Key**: Not everything in the knowledge base needs to be on the resume. Select the most relevant information for the target role.

2. **ATS Optimization**: Use standard section headers, avoid tables/columns, include keywords from JD naturally.

3. **Length**: For candidates with < 5 years experience, aim for 1 page worth. For senior candidates, 1.5-2 pages worth of content is acceptable.

4. **Formatting**: Keep Markdown simple (headings, bold, italics, lists). Avoid complex formatting that breaks when exported to DOCX.

5. **Truthfulness**: Never fabricate. If the knowledge base lacks relevant information, acknowledge the gap by omitting that section or being brief.

6. **Action Verbs**: Start bullets with strong verbs: Led, Built, Architected, Launched, Increased, Reduced, Managed, Designed, Implemented, Achieved, etc.

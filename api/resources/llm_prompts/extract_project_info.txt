4. **Skills Demonstrated**: Technical and soft skills shown through the project
5. **Timeline**: Start and end dates if mentioned

**Guidelines:**
- Extract projects from project reports, technical documents, portfolios, or proposals
- If the document describes work done as part of a job/internship, categorize it as experience
- If the document is about a personal project, academic project, or side project, categorize it as a project
- Extract ALL technical skills and technologies mentioned
- Capture quantifiable achievements and metrics
- Include URLs, GitHub links, or demo links if present

Return ONLY valid JSON with this exact structure (no markdown, no code blocks):

  "email": "email@example.com (if found)",
  "telephone": "phone number (if found)",
  "skills": ["Skill1", "Skill2", "Technology1", "Framework1"],
  "projects": [
    {
      "name": "Project Name",
      "description": "Detailed description of what the project does, its purpose, and outcomes",
      "technologies": ["Tech1", "Tech2", "Framework1"],
      "url": "https://project-url.com (if mentioned)",

    }
  ],
  "education": []
}

**IMPORTANT:**
- If the document is clearly a project report/documentation, put content in "projects" array
- If the document describes work experience/internship, put content in "experience" array
- Extract as many relevant skills as possible from the technical content
- Leave arrays empty [] if no relevant information is found
- Do not make up information - only extract what's explicitly in the document

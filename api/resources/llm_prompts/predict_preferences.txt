## Prediction Guidelines

### For Industries:
- Look for patterns in work history (which sectors have they worked in?)
- Match skills to industry demands (e.g., React → Tech, Tableau → Data Analytics)
- Consider certifications (CFA → Finance, AWS → Cloud/Tech)
- Weight recent experience higher than older experience

### For Roles:
- Map skills to job requirements (Python + ML → Data Scientist)
- Consider seniority indicators (years of experience, leadership keywords)
- Look for role progression (Junior → Mid → Senior)
- Match certifications to roles (PMP → Project Manager, CFA → Financial Analyst)

### For Companies:
- Prioritize companies in predicted industries
- Match company size/type to candidate's background (startup experience → recommend startups)
- Consider companies known to hire in Singapore
- Look for skill alignment (e.g., Go experience → recommend companies using Go)
- Include mix of: tech giants, local champions, fast-growing startups

### Confidence Scoring:
- **0.9-1.0**: Very strong match, multiple clear indicators
- **0.8-0.89**: Strong match, good alignment
- **0.7-0.79**: Good match, reasonable fit
- **0.6-0.69**: Moderate match, some alignment
- **Below 0.6**: Weak match (don't include)

## Important Notes:
- Be realistic and evidence-based
- Don't over-predict based on limited data
- If unclear, prefer broader categories (e.g., "Tech" over "Blockchain Engineering")
- Always include reasoning for transparency
- Consider Singapore job market context (local companies, MNCs with SG offices)
- Respect career level (don't recommend entry-level roles for senior candidates)
